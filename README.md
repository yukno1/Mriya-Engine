# Mriya-Engine
My Own Game Engine

Based on Cherno/Hazel

Using C++ and C#, maybe Python, RUST?
later, when compiler support, may use features of C++23

Focus on Windows (DirectX, OpenGL)

AI native support (MCP, neural renderering, ...)

Not sure how to build display panel

May later fork out the Hazel part
